                    <h3>Plans and Progress: </h3>
                    <p>
                        This project idea began during assignment two,
                        about two weeks into the project. The idea is a
                        Horror Stories website which came from one of
                        our old group members Marc who is no longer with
                        us. This idea takes inspiration from the original
                        ideas of members, such as Tristan’s MusicHub.
                        Which we discussed as being difficult to sell/market
                        since there are many existing popular alternatives
                        such as Spotify or iTunes. Along with the legality
                        to use copyrighted music. On the other hand, in the
                        realm of horror stories, there is no popular website
                        or centralised place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the plan is to create a website
                        that will allow users to read and share
                        their horror story experiences. Within
                        the website, we intend on including
                        sub-sections of real estate, employment,
                        dating, shopping, travelling and beliefs.
                        From each sub-section, there will be options
                        to enter another section. We also plan to
                        include user ratings and comments for the
                        stories. Along with setting preferences
                        for the types or categories of horror
                        stories recommended to the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On our website, we planned to have a homepage
                        that will have the options to read or sign into
                        the website. Signing up or logging in, allows
                        the users to add their own stories, leave comments,
                        provide ratings and preferences of stories decided
                        by the user. Our final project idea would be better
                        than Reddit, Pinterest or Imgur since we would utilise
                        the best components of each website, to make a
                        centralized hub for horror stories. We think that
                        our website would be preferred to the alternative
                        since it is specific to horror stories and people
                        can find precisely what they are looking for.
                        Instead of having to find sub-reddit’s or threads,
                        they will be available in one place which increases
                        convenience and accessibility. People will prefer
                        our website because of those reasons and once people
                        start sharing their horror stories/experiences, it
                        will create an environment where those interested
                        will join to add their own stories or comment on
                        their feelings or thoughts about others. Which would
                        lead to a bigger userbase and a niche desire for horror
                        stories to be fulfilled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, would have a user homepage like Imgur where they could view a snapshot of all the stories on a page which would consist of an image and the heading/name of the user’s stories along with the category it would fit into. To stop this page from being overwhelming there will be preference options that would allow users to choose categories of horror stories they want to view, recent/old. When a user would click on a story, they would view the story like a Reddit thread. However, there would be a set format of title at the top, then the story below, followed by ratings and comments below that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this venture to be profitable we could use monetisation in the form of ads on the website that would appear on the sides like many websites currently. Another option is allowing users to pay a certain amount for preference in the user's feed for a set time so that their story could gain traction. Moreover, content creators on YouTube such as Mr Nightmare could be sponsored to promote the website, so it can gain traction and attention, which will increase the userbase, and the number of people aware of the website itself. This could also form a mutually beneficial relationship where he could use the stories of the website itself for his YouTube videos giving it added exposure without any sponsorship.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Progress:</h3>
                    <p>
                        When we started the development of the project idea. We realised that using WordPress to create a database for the stories, and logins would be unrealistic. Considering there would be a learning curve to understand how to use WordPress and implement it into our website. Nikola will attempt to develop the final website as much as possible in the given time. Along with a wireframe document he created which gives a visual representation on how we intend on laying out the website in the last version. In addition, Sean decided to create a program in Visual Studio in the programming language of VB.NET which would be a prototype of the website itself. Instead of being online, it would be offline. To store the logins a CSV file was used. To store the stories a .txt file was used. To store the comments a CSV file was used. At the end of week 10, Sean has got a fully working login and signup system. The system includes validation checks. The validation checks are to ensure the username and password are empty. In addition, a length check of the username so long names are not entered. Along with username checks to ensure the same username is not being re-used, since it should be unique to each account. Finally, there is a password check when signing up to ensure the password and confirm password text match. Therefore, the user must sign up or log in, to view the stories which are done for security purposes and simplicity. However, in the future, there may be an option to view the stories without logins being necessary.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After logging in, the program leads you to a page where you choose the category of the story. Currently the only category is home alone stories. After the user clicks on the button a page opens which shows the story allows comments. By the end of the prototype development, we hope to include a rating system, the ability for existing users to upload their own story and choose the category it fits into. Right now, it seems unlikely we will get all of that in the completed version of the program. Considering it seems exceedingly difficult to implement a feature to allow the user to be able to add their own horror stories and for the program to be able to add the new stories to a particular category. Since the stories are currently hardcoded into each category. It would be difficult to verify whether the story uploaded would fit into the category itself without having trust, that the user uploads relevant stories. Another issue currently is the users' details not being encrypted or hashed at all leaving all users vulnerable to their details being stolen. In addition, adding encryption/hashing which would allow the password to be read and retrieved for login purposes would be necessary in the future. Usually when hashing occurs or if the password is salted then it cannot be reversed for login purposes, implying it would be difficult to add. It seems more feasible that an admin page would be created and have additional controls such as: modifying stories, adding stories, moderating/editing comments and managing usernames and passwords. Moreover, when adding comments there is no verification since the username used to log in is not saved and transferred for comment purposes therefore a user could put any username for the comments section and there would be no way of knowing which user wrote that comment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In week 11, the prototype was further developed. Instead of allowing the user who is already logged in to choose their username when adding a comment to the story. Now the username is set to the one used to login in for purposes of verification. So, that there are no impersonations of existing users or inappropriate comments made anonymously. In addition, there was an option added when starting the program to allow non-existing users to view the stories. This function would limit non-existing users to only being allowed to view the stories. Without the options to view/add comments making that the incentive to sign up and become a user. There was also an attempt to have exclusive functions for the admin to allow editing of the logins and comments CSV file, along with the stories themselves. However, an error occurred which was System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception when attempting to open the files. This was due to the fact a 64-bit version was used instead of a 32-bit system however the target CPU was set to any so this should not be an issue. The code used for this was adapted from an Ordering system Sean made in year 12 that used the .NET 4.8 framework. Considering now what is being used is the .NET 6.0 core there could be differences that Sean is not aware of how to overcome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In week 11, Nikola added a login and register section for the website which is not operational but provides a visual representation of how it would work if the prototype functionality were implemented into the website itself. In the register section a user id, email and password would be the requirements to register along with the action of agreeing to the terms and conditions of the website itself. In the login section, you require the user id and password which was used to register, along with an option to remember me for future logins. The colour scheme used was black and red to reflect the horror theme and to be consistent with the rest of the website. Although not functional, there is a validation check to ensure an email is entered when signing up. In conjunction with a check that the fields are filled on the register and login screens
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In week 12, the prototype was finished and the issue of attempting to open files was fixed. The issue was caused by a change in the way the visual studio opened files in the .NET core versions of Visual Studio compared to the .NET framework. This meant that even though the code was correct for the .NET framework, previously used by Sean he had to adapt it to the .NET core version, he is currently using. Therefore, he was incorrect in his previous assumptions in week 11 about it being related to the operating system, but rather it was the differences between the .NET Core and .NET Framework themselves. Specifically, the differences are that in the .NET framework UseShellExecute defaults to true meaning files can be opened with the code, Process.Start(IO.Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath & "\Users\logins.csv")) without any errors. Whereas, in the .NET Core, the same code will cause the exception error mentioned two paragraphs prior to this one. Since the UseShellExecute defaults to false meaning that the code will never work the way, it is currently without adaption to the .Net Core version. Alternatively, the code required was this, Process.Start(New ProcessStartInfo(IO.Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath & "\Users\logins.csv")) With {.UseShellExecute = True}). This means that Sean was required to add specific information to change the default UseShellExecute to true which overcomes the previous error encountered. This knowledge was acquired from ( JohnH, 2021)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, an admin exclusive section was added which allows the administrator to modify users, ratings, comments, and stories. Modifications encompass additions, deletions, and changes to the files themselves which will be viewable by the existing and non-existing users. These additions to the system will allow the admin to ensure there is some form of executive control so that there is moderation of comments, changing/updating the horror stories and control over users’ accounts if they are writing malicious or inappropriate comments and allow changes to ratings depending on if the administrator suspects there is collusion by users to downvote a particular story. Necessarily, there was a Test UI (User Interface) button added so that the administrator can see if their changes have been formatted/saved correctly, and so that they can view everything from the user’s perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another addition to the program was a rating system for the stories so that users can add their opinion of how good/bad they think the story was and they can view each other’s ratings. For this, to work there was a validation check of users to ensure they weren’t adding more than a single rating for the story. This ensures that the rating system is not filled with one user’s multiple ratings of one story which hinders the ability of other users to see their ratings. Furthermore, there were components of the home alone horror story page which allowed users and non-users to edit the story, comments, and ratings this was changed to read-only to improve the integrity of the program, even though the changes that could be made had no impact on the usage of the program, fixing it makes the program cleaner. The rating system allows the user to increment/decrement their rating using the buttons to change the textbox value. Then by clicking add rating their rating is added along with the rest. Instead of allowing edits of the textbox directly like the comments, which would require many more validations, comparable to the number when signing up. To ensure the rating is between 1 and 5 it is much simpler to make the textbox read-only and only allow changes with the buttons which greatly reduces the validation checks required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simple tweaks and changes to the program also included the widening of the home alone story section to allow everything to fit into the form without it appearing cluttered and overwhelming. Along with the ability to go back from the home alone story section to the story categories section which increases the usability of the program. The last change was some additional categories added to the story categories section which do not work but improve the visual appearance of the program and give insight to the users for what is to come.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarise what was included in the final prototype. There is an option to read stories whether you’re an existing user or a non-user visiting the application for the first time. There are working signup and login systems with validation checks. There are options to add/view comments and ratings if you are an existing user. Along with, an administrative section added specifically for the administrator to be able to have executive control, over the application to moderate comments or usernames and update stories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given an extended time allocation Sean would further develop the program to allow a selection of more categories instead of the single category currently available. Along with an ability to preference the order of categories that appear depending on the preferences of the user. There would also be additional validation checks added to the signup and comments section to ensure inappropriate words/phrases aren’t being used for a username or in the comments section. There would also be improvements in the formatting of comments to ensure that they can be fully read. Instead of only allowing the administrator to upload/update stories there would be an option to upload their own stories with credit given at the bottom of the story with the uploader’s username. Furthermore, an option to view the average rating of a particular story would be added for ease-of-use purposes, without the users having to scroll through the ratings, to gage the opinions of the story themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything previously mentioned would have to be adapted to a website which would mean having to store everything on a database/ server. Specifically, the user details, comments, ratings, stories, user preferences. Along with an expansion on the categories available and the number of stories in each category. For the user details, it is recommended that a third party is used to handle that portion of the website considering storing and securing user’s details is very difficult to maintain and costly. The third-party examples include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Which can be used for signing in which removes the necessity to include a signup component and outsources the security to companies which have the funds to ensure their users are constantly protected.

                        For our project, we are creating a website with HTML and CSS. Our website is on GitHub and is available to the public. Although all our team members have heard about GitHub, none had prior experience using it. There are many integrated development environments to choose from and work with; however, our team members Nikola and Sean have some experience with the Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 from Microsoft. This software is free for education but can also be paid for, enabling many other features. In year eight, Sean attended coding classes and started his learning experience in Visual Studio. He is passionate about learning more and gaining experience in programming. Sean has created our primary prototype of the website, a login system that can be used to store stories and users’ login information. This was developed using Visual Studio and the programming language VB.NET. Nikola created a few websites both at Tafe and in his own time, primarily in HTML and CSS. Most of our team members have some experience with HTML already from the first assignments and before this course. Connor is more of a computer guy and likes to build computers. He is determined to learn HTML to create websites. Our team members Tristan and Tulle are interested in games, and Tristan has also managed to build his gaming computer. While Tulle is more interested in game development, Tristan wants to explore web development.

                    <p>
                        Firstly, we need to have a functional computer that can support running programs without difficulties. It’s important to talk about what everyone is most comfortable doing as some may have some experience before this and don’t need to dedicate more time to learning how to use a tool they have seen. There are many risks involved when there’s a lot of individual data gathered by the team members working on the project. Things can happen that we can’t prepare for. That’s why it is essential to backup all necessary documents. This could prevent losing important assignment material. The most significant risks we’ve seen were bugs in the code which took a long time to research how to fix. This can sometimes be very challenging because selecting the code and changing it to find a solution can create a different problem that will take even longer to resolve; for this reason, it’s always essential to have copies of our work and code. For our next task, we may have to familiarise ourselves with new tools to develop a functional prototype of our website. This may be another risk factor as each needs to allocate their time to finish tasks and research new things while dealing with their personal life and other duties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our primary artifact is also our prototype of how the website would work. Sean has created an application using VB.NET and programmed its functionalities with Visual Studio. The program uses a CSV file to store the logins and a .txt file for individual stories. For now, we have decided that our prototype will have a login system with the user directly registering and signing in with a valid password and username. We are also aware of the risks involved in passwords and user information such as their name and email address. Hackers can potentially use the “dictionary attack” technique to try and match possible password guesses. A dictionary attack uses lists containing phrases, words, and common variations and is highly likely to match the user’s password. For our program, we would need a computer that would be used as a server and each user registered to our website would have created a cookie file that stores their ID session and keeps the user logged in. This cookie file is created once the user registers their login information. The server will automatically match the session ID from the user’s cookie file, which has this information stored and log them in. This would be a considerable risk, and we will need to research ways of securing these passwords with some encryption method. Possibly a two-way authentication method could be used.

                        To complete the assignment to the best of our ability we have committed to at least two meetings each week, sometimes we will have three depending on the attendance at the meetings. The only exception being submission week, where we may only have one since the due date is a Wednesday. These meetings will be held online since the course is online and it is the most feasible and realistic option. Considering some people live in different states, expecting them to travel inter-state is completely unreasonable and others have other commitments making in person meetings almost impossible. Time is also a consideration even if we all live in the same state the additional time for transportation would impact everyone’s other commitments.

                    <p>
                        We will be primarily communicating on Microsoft teams and emails if necessary. We are using Microsoft teams primarily as it has the best functionality for project work collaboration, communication, and file sharing. Microsoft teams will be the first step to contact anyone in the group if they do not respond then emails will be utilized. We will also maintain constant communication through the posts section in teams to update everyone else on issues or problems we are facing.
