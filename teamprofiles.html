					<h3>Connor Coussens</h3>
					<p>
						My name is Connor Coussens, my student number is S3956701 and our group name is Room 15. I am 16 years old and live in Brisbane. I am currently doing year 12 via home school and studying this subject in term 1. In my free time, I enjoy exercising, playing video games and learning German as a second language. I am not sure why I am so interested in computers, all I know is that since I was a small child, I have been trying to understand how they operate. Considering I live in a small town it makes it difficult. My father is my biggest inspiration to get into computers. He would explain things in deep and passionate detail whenever I asked him about his pc when I was younger. From then on, I always tried to tinker with computers. It began with me teaching prep kids how to use google and helping my grandparents with computer issues to making computers for friends and siblings. From this course, I want to learn HTML to create a website and use programs like GitHub to collaborate with peers and learn the current state of the IT industry from a professional.

					<h3>Tristan Frank</h3>
					<p>
						My name is Tristan Frank, my student number is S3957142, and our group name is Room 15. I am 19 and graduated from St Michael's Grammar School in 2020. My background on my mum’s side is Scottish, Irish, English and primarily convict Aussie. My dad’s side is German. I played A-grade tennis, where I won 2 grand finals before stopping due to COVID in year 12. Furthermore, I’m also a big fan of AFL, F1 and Soccer, where I support the Sydney Swans, McLaren and Chelsea/Melbourne Victory respectively. My interest in IT mainly comes from gaming, playing Club Penguin when it launched. Throughout primary school, I would play Call of Duty, Minecraft and Pirates of the Caribbean Online with my friends. At the end of 2020, I built my first gaming PC, which was a stressful yet exciting project that introduced me to a new area of IT. Since then, I’ve yearned to learn more about the world of IT and how it works, which is why I’m now studying Information Technology. Aside from gaming, my knowledge of IT is minimal, During the completion of this degree, I’d specifically like to learn how to write code & build websites since the idea of Web Design & development appeals to me the most.

					<h3>Nikola Djordjevic</h3>
					<p>
						My name is Nikola Djordjevic, my student number is S3955556 and I am half Serbian and half Slovakian, born in Australia. Our group name is Room 15. In 2019 I decided to change my career and pursue my passion for information and technology. Without any experience and a long break from studying, I took the opportunity and started to do certificates at TAFE. This was the first step in my IT career, and it was the best decision I could make. After completing Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and technology, I started to look more into which direction and career to choose. I always dreamed of learning how to code as stories of hackers always fascinated me. I decided to go for programming and completed a Certificate IV in Programming. I finally landed my first job in IT, and that’s also one of the reasons I decided to study at RMIT. Working in IT and studying IT makes me entirely focused on my path. I am familiar with C#, JAVA, SQL, and Kotlin. I hope to be confident in programming and ready for future jobs in the Software development field.

					<h3>Marc Dwyer</h3>
					<p>
						My name is Marc Dwyer, my student number is S9511620. Our group name is Room 15. I’m Australian and have always lived in Melbourne or rural Victoria and only speak English. Though I’ve tried learning Russian, now it’s probably best that I didn’t. I’m the youngest of three and will be turning 50 this year. I’ve previously studied a certificate 3 in IT in the ’90s, an advanced diploma in IT in the 00’s with several certifications attached. Recently I was certified in Prince 2 Foundation and Prince 2 Practitioner as I was looking to get into Project Management, but due to the time length that I’ve been out of IT.

When I was about ten years old in the early ’80s my brother had a Dick Smith System 80 that was tape loaded. When he wasn’t home, I’d move the computer to my room to play games. After a while, I started to learn to modify the code and even create my games, no books or internet then just looking at the code. My main interest is in programming.
