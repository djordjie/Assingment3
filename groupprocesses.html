                        After the completion of assignment two we learnt a lot.
                        At the beginning everything was going well we decisively
                        allocated work to each other. There were some issues relating
                        to the attendance of the meetings. Some people had emergencies 
                        and issues that arise that could not be avoided. We were also
                        flexible with the meeting times to assure the maximum number 
                        of members could attend the following meeting. An issue that
                        created lots of friction and disagreement was the late 
                        submission of drafts which caused unnecessary stress for
                        the other members and arguments which damages the trust
                        people have with each other. Another issue was the lack 
                        of communication sometimes which led to people not knowing 
                        exactly what was expected next meeting. Overall, we learnt
                        a lot from each other which will allow us to work better
                        together in this assignment. To rectify some of these problems
                        we commit to having more open communication with each other 
                        to assure we are aware of any issues a member may be having 
                        completing their section of the assignment. So, there is time
                        for other members to help or complete the work for them if 
                        necessary. Another measure we are taking is asking for weekly 
                        updates on work that has been done so that members are aware 
                        of each other’s progress of their designated sections and to
                        stop potential cramming of work at the end. To improve communication
                        and transparency we will also try our best to be more punctual for
                        each meeting leading to more productive meetings and an increase 
                        in morale for the group.
