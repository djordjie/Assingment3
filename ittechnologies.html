                    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The current best available example of this technology is the Tesla Model S which is not completely
                        autonomous and still requires a driver to always have their hands on the steering wheel. The features
                        of this car are autopilot and enhanced autopilot. Best self-driving cars 2022 | heycar 2022, Heycar.co.uk,

                            . The features included in autopilot
                            are traffic-aware cruise control which detects the speed of the nearby cars and sets your speed accordingly.
                            The other feature is autosteer: which keeps the car driving within two marked lines on either side.
                            The enhanced autopilot consists of auto lane change, auto park, summon and smart summon. Auto lane
                            change aids the driver when merging onto freeways or highways. Auto Park, as the name suggests aids
                            in parking, particularly for perpendicular and parallel spaces. Summon aids in parking and leaving
                            small park spaces. Smart summon is a feature that allows you to send your car from its parking spot
                            directly to your stationary position assuming you are in the direct vicinity. Autopilot and Full

                                    Currently what can be done is that to improve this technology is to continue to utilise it so it better
                                    adapts to the changing road conditions and variations of human behaviour, so they are safer to use.
                                    Another benefit is that flaws can be revealed, and improvements can be made to improve current and
                                    future autonomous vehicles. In addition, a way to improve autonomous vehicles is by improving
                                    our roads and infrastructure related to driving so that autonomous vehicles can easily detect road
                                    lanes, traffic lights, signs, and potential obstacles. To make autonomous vehicles more mainstream
                                    other car companies should invest in similar technology to Tesla leading to more competition and more
                                    options for the consumer which makes the costs lower to purchase an autonomous vehicle increasing the
                                    potential for middle-class people to purchase them. This encourages investment in the technology leading
                                    to faster developments and improvement. In combination with this, the stigma surrounding the safety
                                    of autonomous vehicles must be discussed and reduced or eliminated. Otherwise, the developments are
                                    pointless if people do not feel safe, they will always use an alternative.
                                </p>

                                    In the future three years,
                                    I predict that autonomous vehicles will become more mainstream and utilised by a greater percentage of the
                                    population. I think that there will be completely autonomous vehicles however they still may require the driver
                                    to be awake. However, I think that they will no longer have to touch the steering wheel to keep autopilot engaged.
                                    I think iris detection could be used to assure the driver is awake as a precautionary measure. Other than that,
                                    I think they will be completely autonomous and able to drive long distances. I think that some countries will be
                                    more open to the idea of fully autonomous vehicles and adjust their laws to accommodate them on the roads while
                                    others will be reluctant to allow them to be used. I think there will also be completely autonomous vehicles without
                                    any human interaction on university campuses and headquarters of companies where the terrain is familiar and does not
                                    have much variation daily.

                                    What has allowed autonomous vehicles to get to the stage where they are currently is
                                    the continual automation and development of electronics, within vehicles to reduce the manual and mechanical
                                    activities in vehicles. This results in more automated processes and less human interference required.
                                    With the continual development of radar sensors, light detection and ranging sensors, ultraviolet sensors, and

                                        This allowed for nearby obstacles such as cars, pedestrians and motorbikes to be detected. Along with footpaths,
                                        curbs, traffic lights and signs. Overall reducing the amount of human intervention required to drive in these vehicles.

                                <h3>What is the likely impact?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    The impact of the vehicle industry continuing to automate and develop autonomous technology is a temporary
                                    increase in the cost to purchase an autonomous vehicle while overall there will be a reduction in costs as with
                                    all technology. Due to autonomous vehicles usually being electric or hybridised I believe a reduction in petrol
                                    cars on the roads is inevitable along with the production of them. Also, the perception of autonomous vehicles
                                    being unsafe will reverse, meaning people will think it is more unsafe to drive their cars. There will be a reduction
                                    in human-driven cars, the road toll which is caused by human error and emissions into the environment since autonomous
                                    cars are usually fully electric or hybridised. The people most affected by this shift are people who earn their living
                                    by driving vehicles. This encompasses uber drivers, taxi drivers and truck drivers who will lose their job since autonomous
                                    driving will be safer and cheaper than using a human. I think mechanics will also be impacted to a lesser degree than uber,
                                    taxi or truck drivers. Considering there will always be some mechanical components that a mechanic can fix. On the other hand
                                    since vehicles are becoming more technologically advanced like with Tesla, an average mechanic cannot fix problems due to all
                                    the technology and potential electrical dangers. Leading to the replacement of many people with technology and these people
                                    will have to learn new skills to get a job. I think it will create more jobs relating to the development and innovation to
                                    improve autonomous vehicles and electrical mechanics for the vehicles. However, I believe that the number of jobs will be
                                    minuscule in contrast with the number of jobs lost. Resulting in an overall increase in the unemployment rate of people.

                                <h3>How will this affect you?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    In my daily life, there will be many changes due to the advancement in autonomous technology.
                                    Such as the possibility that I’ll own a self-driving vehicle and will not have to drive the car
                                    contrasting to now when learning how to drive is a necessity to commute to your desired locations.
                                    Some will sell their existing car which is not driverless in exchange for one that is, which is safer
                                    and more convenient. If I travel using a car or public transport such as buses and trains, I will have
                                    to adapt to the reality that there might be no human driver. Which is a barrier I would find difficult
                                    to overcome since I am so used to there being human drivers. Another effect would be the ability to work
                                    on my computer, mobile or talk without endangering others since I am not driving when using a driverless
                                    car. This will affect my family and friends differently depending on their ages. I think my parents and
                                    older people, in general, will be far more reluctant to utilise an autonomous car. As they are so accustomed
                                    to driving themselves that they may never adopt its usage unless forced to. Whereas I think younger
                                    generations will be more willing to accept it. Considering they are more familiar with technology
                                    and have greater trust in using it. There will be a reduced emphasis on learning to drive since vehicles
                                    drive themselves. However, I think people who still love the thought to be able to drive themselves
                                    will still learn. Particularly, if they want to drive older cars that are not autonomous and get the
                                    experience of driving many future generations may not receive. I think that family members I have that
                                    are mechanics will learn skills in the technology field. So, they can continue to work with driverless
                                    cars and be qualified to repair them.

                                    Currently what can be done with the Arduino is making machines and electronics.
                                    An example, in year 11 I made various simple circuits such as light sensors and a
                                    prototype of a water cooler in year 12. The idea was a button is pressed and a drink
                                    is spun with water surrounding it to cool the drink. As it spins using a motor and a
                                    temperature sensor to detect when the drink reaches a certain temperature then the cooler
                                    automatically turns off. As mentioned previously a Raspberry pi is commonly used for
                                    creating a video game emulator console that utilises the retro pie program which is
                                    installed onto the raspberry pi OS (Operating System) and allows emulation of older
                                    video games such as NES, SNES, and older games. Other uses for the raspberry pi are
                                    using Linux operating system which allows a keyboard, mouse and monitor to be connected
                                    and be used as a computer. There are other alternatives such as the Odroid XU4 or
                                    UDOO BOLT V8 which can be used to create a better performing computer however they

                                    Within the next three years, I predict the changes that will be made
                                    to these small computing devices will be similar and predictable. Meaning
                                    that they will just improve the specifications of the existing devices available
                                    on the market. Without any major innovation or developments made on the existing
                                    boards. I think the changes for the raspberry pi will be that they will make will
                                    be increased ram, improved processor, and GPU. In addition, I think the USB ports
                                    will be improved and that there will be USB 4.0 or even 5.0 connectivity allowing
                                    faster transfer speeds to and from the boards. For the Arduino, I believe they will
                                    increase the number of pins for connections, USB- c connection and an improved
                                    microcontroller. Concerning the MakeyMakey, I do not think any improvements
                                    will be made since it’s made for children to be simple.

                                    The technological developments that make these improvements
                                    possible are the continual developments of those components
                                    mentioned above which are used in other electrical devices
                                    such as laptops or mobile phones to improve speeds and capabilities
                                    to perform tasks. These developments applied will allow the boards
                                    to work faster and efficiently. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>What is the likely impact?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    The potential impact of these improvements in the raspberry pi and similar
                                    computing boards is that people become savvier with technology and begin to
                                    purchase more of these boards causing sales to increase, therefore they will
                                    have to increase production to meet the consumer demand. Consequently, desktop
                                    computer sales will decrease. Considering the raspberry pi’s capacity to operate
                                    as a computer and complete the same tasks except being very portable, compared
                                    to its desktop counterpart which is not portable at all. I think the Arduino will
                                    be used similarly to now. I think there will be more potential for bigger projects
                                    which require more pins and complex wiring. I think the people who will be most
                                    affected are the consumer who will have more options to access cheaper hardware
                                    that is small and portable. Furthermore, the companies that produce desktop
                                    computers, will have to produce more gaming-focused PCs (Personal Computers).
                                    Due to the reality that a raspberry pi will be able to run Windows OS and complete
                                    the same menial tasks as a standard PC except for a fraction of the price and size.
                                    I do not think many current jobs will be created or replaced. Nevertheless,
                                    the technology which outdated such as USB 2.0 or USB 3.0, processors, and microcontrollers,
                                    will certainly be made redundant because there are more advanced alternatives for a minor
                                    increase in cost. Another consideration is that they are more affordable since they would
                                    cost under 500 dollars with all the other components, whereas a standard PC costs upwards
                                    of $1000. This factor and portability will take priority for the consumer, over the best
                                    specifications for gaming. Since many people will never play any hardware-intensive video
                                    games since they will understand they are wasting their money, paying for features they will never use. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>How will this affect you?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    This will affect the sense when I go to internet cafes or libraries with the current
                                    standard PCs. Instead, this will have options with just a monitor, keyboard, and mouse
                                    where people can utilise their raspberry pi/hardware with the added security measures of
                                    their hardware and therefore they are using their own PC. Instead of having to purchase
                                    a laptop or set up a PC. I will be able to use raspberry pi or Odroid or UDOO BOLT for
                                    the same functionality that can fit in my pocket or satchel without having to carry a
                                    laptop around or be limited to access in one place. For the Arduino I envision, people
                                    will use these to innovate, tinker and improve upon existing technology. I think they
                                    will gain a deeper understanding of how electronics work along with fostering creativity
                                    and the development of new products and inventions that do not exist due to technological
                                    restraints. This will positively affect my friends and family, meaning that will be exposed
                                    to computing devices that allow them to improve their technical understanding of computing,
                                    electronics, and circuits. Whereas previously it was perceived to be nerdy or only for younger
                                    people interested in IT, I think it will be mainstream. People will be able to understand
                                    computing boards and will able more confident in attempting to fix their existing computers
                                    or technology. Since they will be capable of understanding what the potential issues could
                                    be and the course of action to fix them. Contrary to the current situation where people
                                    usually just buy a new device, instead of attempting to repair it.

                                <h3>What does it do?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    The cloud refers to the access of servers through the internet and the software and databases
                                    that run on them. Using a provider and the internet physical servers can be accessed from anywhere
                                    at any time, allowing users to interact and connect with Infrastructure, platforms, and software
                                    that they would not normally have access to. It allows users to store information on servers rather
                                    than their hardware. This can be used for storage of data on a server which is only limited by the
                                    amount that the user is willing to pay for. It also gives a neutral location to store data allowing
                                    for safer and easier collaboration. Along with access to subscription-based software, Such as OneDrive. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The current state of Cloud computing allows for organizations and individuals to easily configure the
                                    structure to allow for easy handling of applications. Which allows for an array of services to be provided,
                                    such as the access to Infrastructure, Platforms, and software. This is done by a provider and works as a
                                    pay-per-use system, so you only pay for what you desire. In its current state it allows for flexibility
                                    and easy scalability to increase or decrease the system depending on the users demands. This has allowed
                                    for increased developer productivity, increased application performance and flexible global scaling. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The current applications of cloud computing cover many areas such as testing and development, storage,
                                    disaster recovery, infrastructure, and platforms. Firstly, testing and development has been improved
                                    dramatically with the ability to acquire already made environments which can be tailored to suit the
                                    user’s needs, this elevates the need for physical assets, time, and unneeded effort. Secondly cloud
                                    storage allows users to store and access data on or off premises, using a third-party provider, which
                                    allows for storage without the need for infrastructure and security. Thirdly it allows for cost effective
                                    disaster recovery, thanks to cloud-based backups and recovery procedures put in place by the providers.
                                    Lastly infrastructure and platforms allow for subscription-based services, which works as a pay-as-you-go
                                    process giving users access to IT infrastructure and platforms for developing, managing, and running
                                    applications. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The probable future of cloud computing is the expansion of the accessibility of more information.
                                    It is most likely that improvement and expansion will be done in the areas that already utilize cloud
                                    computing such as health care, education, and marketing. Cloud computing has been applied in healthcare
                                    in the form of digital records which can be accessed from almost any clinic, it can be expected that cloud
                                    computing will become more prominent in this field in the coming years with the increase of digital
                                    formatting. It is also probable that education will continue down the path of cloud computing, with
                                    the normalization of remote learning and digital libraries. Marketing will be another area which will
                                    further normalize cloud computing with the increase of online shopping, which will help improve marketing
                                    strategies and increase customer interaction. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The main technology that has enabled cloud computing is virtualization, which allows for the one physical
                                    computer to create additional virtual system which can be used to create, manage, and perform tasks. This
                                    allowed companies to sell access to these systems over the internet so that users can have access to hardware
                                    that is in a different location. This gave access to company’s and users that needed/wanted a system but did
                                    not want to own and maintain the hardware, so they decided it was safer or more affordable to outsource. This
                                    alongside the increased demand for space, security and affordability in the digital world resulted in what is
                                    known as ‘The Cloud’ or cloud computing.
                                </p>
                                <h3>What is the likely impact?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    The impact that cloud computing could have on a business level would be the reduction of cost and flexibility
                                    of the systems. Cloud computing works with a pay-per-use system so business will not have to use as much money
                                    to maintain their systems. The flexibility of cloud computing allows a comfortable fit for any business
                                    who needs a system as it can be tailored to the needed specifications. Security and disaster recovery will
                                    be increased, and resources can be scaled as need be to suit the needed desire. It will have effects on Health
                                    care, education, and shopping as they become more digital, as it allows for better collaboration and sharing
                                    of data, along with accessibility, for users and businesses. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The people who will be most affected with the change to the cloud would be everyone from, business owners,
                                    workers, and users. Such as teachers and how they will teach content from anywhere without difficulty.
                                    Students will be able to access their work, content, software, and digital libraries from anywhere,
                                    allowing students to learn without exception. It will also allow for the common individual to store data
                                    , such as photos, documents, programs, in secure locations without the need for bulky hardware.
                                    It will improve the healthcare system, by allowing any clinics to see your records and information,
                                    without the need for tedious transfers. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This will decrease the need for personal IT professionals within business as they transition to the
                                    cloud as it will remove the need for maintenance and upkeep of their systems or servers that would become
                                    obsolete by transferring to a cloud computing system. This does not mean that IT professionals will become
                                    obsolete within the business, but it will encourage them to change the way in which they work for them. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>How will this affect you?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    In my daily life I would use cloud computing to file documents and photos that I wish to keep secure and
                                    out of danger to remove the risk of losing them. This would allow me to keep data secure for a long time
                                    without the need of hardware which would be expensive and limiting for what I would want to use it for.
                                    It would also be beneficial to be able to use to gain access to subscription-based services such as Adobe
                                    Creative cloud, which would give access to programs such as photoshop and illustrator alongside cloud
                                    services such as Dropbox which would allow for easy sharing of files with friends. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I already use cloud computing to access services and save data, but with the further
                                    normalization of this technology I suspect that it would become much more prominent in my life.
                                    I suspect that future places of employment would use cloud computing to save and store data, which
                                    could mean that working from home would become more common, which would allow for more time spend
                                    doing things I find more desirable rather than traveling to and from work. The flexibility of cloud
                                    computing would also be a factor which would assist me, as I would be able to adapt it to whatever
                                    I desired without having to invest in additional hardware.

                                <p>
                                    The effect that this technology will have on my family and friends, is that storing photos
                                    and videos will become easier, more affordable, and more reliable, as they will not be relying
                                    on USBs and SSDs to store them, which would be lost and destroyed. Cloud computing would also add
                                    an extra layer of security to this irreplaceable data. They could also potentially use the technology
                                    to access infrastructure which they cannot afford or do not have access to, to see whether an investment
                                    would be worthwhile.

                                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence which allows programs and software applications
                                    to predict outcomes to increase its accuracy. This allows computers to act without having to explicitly
                                    program it. Machine learning is conducted to solve problems with speed and scale which otherwise could not
                                    be achieved by a human, also allowing for one or multiple tasks to be operated at a time. Through the
                                    algorithms of machine learning and access to data patterns and relationships can be identified and altered
                                    to optimize the desired outcome. It is mostly used to predict new values from the use of historical data.
                                    The algorithms will create an estimate about the data, it is then evaluated to test the accuracy of the
                                    prediction, the process is then repeated to test whether a new data point is more suited. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Current applications of machine learning are currently being used in many fields such as Health care,
                                    Retail, and transportation. Health care uses machine learning to analyze data allowing trends to be identified
                                    which has improved the diagnosis of issues, which is being used to keep track of increase and decrease in
                                    certain illnesses. Retail uses machine learning to identify trends between users by analyzing their purchase
                                    history to anticipate what they are likely to buy in the future. Machine learning is also currently being
                                    used in the transportation sector as the identification of popular routes is used to decide where new roads
                                    should be built and where old ones should be repaired. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With the current technology, machine learning can be used for video games, internet search engines and speech
                                    recognition. Machine learning can be used to teach programs to play games, such as chess or checkers which allows
                                    for people to play against the computer, it is also commonly used within video games as well such as an enemy
                                    predicting where the player will move to after considering their past movement. It is used when searching on the
                                    internet, where it uses extraction to give a prediction of what you are wanting to search depending on what you
                                    have typed already and your past searches. A more complex form of machine learning is teaching a program to identify
                                    human speech for services such as Siri and Alexa. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The main prediction for machine learning is that it will be more heavily applied to computer vision, which allows
                                    for computers to observe the world around them and understand what it is. This technology is already in use today with
                                    facial recognition, but it is currently not evolved enough to identify between objects. For example, the current systems
                                    find it difficult to identify between animals as they are complex shapes, this becomes even more difficult when they
                                    system tries to identify the breed of the animal as the system does not have enough data identify it properly.
                                    This will be overcome in time with the constant optimization of the technology and the increase in access to data. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Machine learning is based on the interaction of brain cells which was demonstrated by a model in a book written
                                    by Donald Hebb in 1949 called ‘The Organization of Behavior’ which covered the communication between neurons.
                                    The principle that was proposed was put into action by Arthur Samuel who in the early 1950’s developed a computer
                                    program which could play chess against him. Due to the limited memory the computer had it could only anticipate
                                    one move in advance, but over time the program evolved into a minimax algorithm. This was the proof of concept
                                    that the scientific community needed to start the advancement of machine learning. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>What is the likely impact?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    The potential impacts of machine learning are the improvement in health care, improved business strategies
                                    and automation. Health care will be improved by an increase in scope of medical data which will enable the prediction
                                    of correlation between cause and effect. Businesses will have access to the technology to understand and predict users'
                                    interests and shopping habits and allow them to target people with promotion and advertising. Automation will be improved
                                    in many ways such as factory lines and self-driving cars which are using machine learning to map roads and to understand
                                    patterns in traffic and transportation. This will increase productivity and effectiveness by finding the optimal solution
                                    for the given problem but potentially at the cost of human interaction. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most consumers of products will be impacted by this technology, even more so with the introduction
                                    of self-driving cars which use machine learning to fine tune their movement, learn about driving patterns
                                    and road rules. Users of social media and internet services will be affected by the retail aspect of machine
                                    learning as companies learn about their shopping patterns and habits, giving them more accurate advertising
                                    opportunities. Everyone will be positively impacted by the identification of medical patterns which could
                                    identify the cause and effect of certain actions and issues, which will help the community become a healthier
                                    place. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This will create jobs for programmers who will develop and manage the technology, in whatever field it
                                    is being used it. Along with added jobs for analysts who will look at the patterns and data created by the
                                    technology and determine if and what it should be used for. There will be a negative side to this as more
                                    and more advancements are made in machine learning, it will slowly take away from other areas which it seeks
                                    to help as it removes the need for teams of people working on problems the technology could work much fast and
                                    with greater success. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>How will this affect you?  </h3>
                                <p>
                                    In my daily life machine learning would affect me by assisting me in writing by autocompleting words and phrases
                                    that I often use or work together to from a cohesive sentence, it would assist me in research by recommending search
                                    results that are relevant to the topic. It could assist me in finding shows or movies that I would be interested in
                                    by looking at what I have previously watched. It assists me with facial recognition, which allows me to wear glasses
                                    while unlocking my phone as it already understands my face structure. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This technology would assist me in whatever I would want to do such as shopping, researching or transportation.
                                    It would change how I would shop as I would find items that I am interested in with ease as they would be
                                    recommended to me through websites and other promotional material. Research would become a lot easier as
                                    more relevant information would be provided to me through searching the search engines I would use. It also
                                    could potentially change the way I travel because of the improvements to self-driving vehicles as they could
                                    assist me with long trips and navigation through unknow areas. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The effect that this technology will have on my family is the introduction of autonomous technology such
                                    as self-driving cars or home devices, which will as time goes on become more excepted. My family at first
                                    would find the introduction of these items intrusive and unwarranted but over time it is highly likely that
                                    they will accept them. They already use voice-controlled tools such as Siri at the moment, but with the evolution
                                    of this technology it is likely that a similar system would be integrated into the home system, which would understand
                                    multiple individual users within a single space, this would defiantly make very dependent on the technology that they
                                    have at their disposal.
