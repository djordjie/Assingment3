                    <p>
                        Room 15's ideal jobs were Front end developer (Tristan), Junior-mid java developer (Sean), Software developer
                        (Marc), IT application developer (Tulle), Software engineer (Connor), and Full-stack software engineer (Nikola).
                        There is a common trend of choosing a developer or engineer role as an ideal job within our group, with 4 developers
                        and 2 engineers respectfully. Developers use programming languages, such as JavaScript, to write, test, debug and
                        maintain computer software and applications. Some common abilities shared by the developers of our group include
                        completing ad-hoc tasks passed down by senior developers, testing, developing and updating new & existing websites,
                        and evaluating & troubleshooting code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These developer roles share similarities with the engineer roles, who are
                        primarily tasked with managing IT systems in their workplaces to ensure that their technology & software is up to date,
                        as well as maintaining computer systems. Software engineers, regular and Full-stack, are responsible for testing,
                        configuring and troubleshooting hardware, software and networking systems, which often requires them to be experienced
                        in multiple programming languages & be able to learn new, complex systems, as highlighted in both Connor and Nikola's
                        ideal job descriptions.
