                    <h3>Github</h3>
                    <p>
                        Github is a user-friendly website based on Git which was created by Linus Torvalds
                        in 2005, as an easy version control database, which is very popular with developers
                        for its said version control.  Github built upon this by creating a friendly user
                        interface that didn’t require the knowledge of line based commands. It is a for profit
                        cloud-based service that allows users to collaborate on projects within their organisation
                        and includes version control.  Once signed into Github users need to create a repository
                        which is where the files will be kept. The user can create subfolders and different
                        branches all of which can be shared publicly or with select users via username and password.
                        Github makes its money from businesses wishing to create secure private repositories
                        for team collaboration.  But is free for users wishing to create public repositories
                        for things such as open-source projects and student assignments. There is also a vast
                        array of extensions from other platforms such as Wordpress that work with Github making
                        it a great way to deploy your project. Not all team members will be using Github, for 
                        assignment 2, only the members creating the website and updating it. For assignment
                        3 all team members will be using Github as we all work on the project.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Github Pages </h3>
                    <p>Github pages allows you to build websites to showcase your portfolio, projects,
                    documentation or other things you want to share online. Github pages is easy to
                    setup as there are no servers, databases and you don’t need to know HTML.  Github
                    uses an opensource tool called Jeckyll that can turn plain text files into websites.
                    Jeckyll also supports templates, templates, drafts and variables.  Github pages allows
                    you to test new concepts prior to deploying the website live and if the test is positive,
                    you can easily push the new content to the live website. </p>
                    <h3>MS Teams </h3>
                    <p>Microsoft Teams has few competitors able to offer an all-in-one office environment. 
                    It offers file sharing, instant messaging, video/audio conference calling and aligns with
                    the Microsoft 365 office suite and their partners. While there are a few shortcomings such
                    as version control of documents and online editing, it has distinguished itself as a leader
                    in this space. Allowing students to use all its features for free certainly encourages its
                    use as these students enter employment and move up through the ranks of their chosen profession. </p>
                    <p>Microsoft Teams has been built from the ground up utilising the Microsoft Azure cloud platform
                    and other Microsoft technologies. It is to use and share documents with the user interface being
                    very user friendly. If you’re not a student the service is available on a subscription based level
                    depending on your requirements. </p>
                    <p>The team uses Microsoft Teams for video meetings twice per week which are recorded and saved,
                    uploading their parts of the project, creating agendas for meetings and notifying each other of updates. </p>
                    <h3>Burning Glass </h3>
                    <p>Burning Glass is a data driven analytical company that provides data led information on the constantly
                    evolving jobs market.  It is aimed at employers, education and job seekers. It uses AI to analyse millions
                    of job listings worldwide and shows where new trends are developing. It has apps for anyone involved in
                    employing, education or looking for a job to show real time trending skills and attributes required.
                    This was used for the Industry Data part of our assignment. </p>
                    <h3>Wordpress </h3>
                    <p>Having been created in 2003 and becoming open-source in 2099, Wordpress
                    is a Content management system that enables users to create highly interactive
                    websites, blogs, etc. All updating and management of the Wordpress source can
                    be completed backend so there is no user interruption.  There is a large number
                    of extensions for Wordpress as it’s open source which means that most webmasters
                    will be able to create a website that fits all their needs.  While there are
                    disadvantages to running a Wordpress site, the advantages certainly outweigh 
                    them, such as, it’s free, the CSS can be customised, different users can have
                    different levels of access, media files can be uploaded easily, and there are
                    many plugins/extensions available. </p>
                    <p>Some of the key features of Wordpress are user management, media management,
                    search engine optimisation and plugin management. For the project idea of Team
                    15 it can be wholly created on the Wordpress templates plus extensions. </p>
                    <p>Wordpress can be incorporated into Github so all team members for assignment 3
                    can make changes for their respective parts in the project. This will allow them
                    to showcase their ideas before the group actually commits to any changes.</p>
