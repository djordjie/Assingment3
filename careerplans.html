                    <h2>Career Plans Brief: </h2>
                    <h3>Connor Coussens: Software Engineer </h3>

                        of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, AWS and React

                        with HTML and CSS during my studies. I also worked
                        on a project to build an app with Kotlin in Android
                        Studio. My plan to be good at these skills is to
                        work on projects and build a portfolio in my future
                        GitHub profile. I believe that is the best way to
                        learn these skills.  

                    </p>
                    <h3>Sean Carboon: Java Developer  </h3>
                    <p>
                        To acquire the skills/qualification of
                        JavaScript, I will gain familiarity
                        throughout the completion of my Bachelor
                        of Information Technology degree. I will
                        gain experience with the latest technologies
                        and a strong understanding of TDD throughout
                        the progress of my degree. To acquire the
                        requirements of Spring boot, AWS and Angular
                        I will complete the relevant certifications
                        on the respective websites.    

                    </p>
                    <h3>Tristan Frank: Front End Developer  </h3>
                    <p>
                        The skills/requirements/qualifications are
                        CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, with 2 years of
                        experience required. Along with CMS, Google
                        APIs, rendering quirks and understand cross-browser
                        compatibility. During the progression of this
                        course, I hope to gain many these requirements
                        for my ideal job   

                    </p>
                    <h3>Tulle Scoffern: Application Developer  </h3>
                    <p>
                        The programming requirements to reach my
                        career goal are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#,
                        .NET, Angular, React, Rest API, MS SQL, SSTS,

                        my studies and over time gain knowledge to help
                        in the pursuit of the career whether it be in
                        this field or another. My career plan has changed
                        from an IT Application Developer to just an
                        Application Developer due to the broadness
                        of the field, but I still require the same
                        skills and will have more job opportunities
                        in the future.   

                    </p>
                    <h2>Career Plan Comparison:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The similarities between the career plans are that
                        everyone hopes to acquire much of their experience
                        and requirements throughout their progression of
                        their degree. Considering we have committed to
                        completing the Bachelor of Information Technology
                        and many of these requirements are taught throughout
                        the degree. However, Sean has stated in
                        addition to the degree he will are acquire
                        the certifications through online courses.
                        Likewise, Nikola has also specifically stated
                        he will build a portfolio on GitHub and throughout
                        the coding of these GitHub websites. He will acquire
                        many of the skills needed.    

                    </p>
                    <h2>Ideal Jobs Comparison:  </h2>
                    <p>
                        The similarities of the skills required are 
                        JavaScript for all the ideal jobs. Another 
                        commonality is HTML and CSS for Nikola, 
                        Tulle and Tristan’s job. Along with C# for 
                        Connor and Tulle’s job. Angular is required 
                        for Tulle and Sean’s job. Nikola and Tulle’s 
                        job requires React. In relation to the 
                        responsibilities for the ideal jobs a 
                        similarity is that they all require good
                        verbal communication skills and the ability 
                        to be able to work well in teams. Also, for
                        Connor and Tristan’s ideal job you must be 
                        able to update, maintain & manage websites 
                        and software. Another few similarities amongst
                        our ideal developer jobs are, Front-end 
                        developers design and create the interactive
                        part of a website that the end user views, 
                        and Java developers use JavaScript to create 
                        detailed elements for webpages, such as 
                        animated graphics and interactive maps. 
                        On the other hand, the differences between 
                        the ideal jobs are that Connor’s job 
                        exclusively requires C/C++ and Objective
                        C. Nikola’s job needs NodeJS. Sean’s job 
                        needs TDD. Tristan requires CMS and Google
                        API’s. Tulle needs .NET, Rest, API, MS SQL,
                        SSTS and TFS. In relation to the responsibility 
                        differences between the ideal jobs, Connor’s job
                        requires the competency to manage individual 
                        project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables. 
                        Nikola’s job requires the ability to learn and 
                        understand complex systems and find opportunities
                        for improvement. Sean’s job desires a strong 
                        technical background in the latest technologies. 
                        Tristan’s job requires ad-hoc projects assigned 
                        from other senior developers. The differences are
                        while engineers mainly work on configuring and 
                        troubleshooting IT systems. Developers focus more
                        on designing and creating new programs along with
                        software through coding. Engineers also work on
                        physical hardware, such as installing and programming 
                        servers, while developers work primarily on creating 
                        functional software and programs.
