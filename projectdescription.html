                    <h3>Topic:</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        The purpose of our project is to demonstrate the skills necessary to be able to build and construct a website where users can view horror stories. These skills will be demonstrated through artifacts which will show critical information about how different parts of the project would be constructed and worked. Along with demonstrating how the different pieces of the project would all work together to become the final product. These artifacts will demonstrate how the website will be set up and show how users could interact with it.
                    </p>

                    <p>These artifacts will include a range of areas which would be used in the final project if it were to be used. The first of which would be a site map depicting how the webpage would be set out in html. Secondly there will be a wire frame of the layout of the webpage which will show what the webpage will look like, depicting where aspects of the project will appear. Thirdly there will be a sub section of our pre-existing webpage which will depict the stories and the content of the webpage. There will also be a prototype of a login-in system which will be made on vb.net, using a visual studio, to illustrate how an identification system could be used within our project.    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Motivation:</h3>
                    <p>The motivation behind the project is to give users a platform or service to be able to view and share a range of horror stories from people’s lives along with fantasy stories which would relate with the platform. This project is interesting because it uses many key skills which could be used in future projects and endeavours, as the use of a website and user interaction plays a big part in the IT industry. This project connects with current IT trends by giving users access to a wide range of content, which is seen in platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest which are big inspiration for the project. This project, if completed, would show a future employee that we possessed the skills to make a cohesive interactive experience for users to view content, from the use of a database and other IT related skills.  </p>
                    <h3>Landscape:   </h3>
                    <p>Other systems and platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest could be seen as similar to our project, as they are our main inspiration, in such ways as user interaction, structure and design. The aspects of these products that we would want to emulate in our own project would be the ease of use for the users like pages of easy-to-read stories, in both video and written form, with a scrolling function to allow users to easily move from page to page. These platforms would be competitors for the fact they have such a shear amount of content in the same style of delivery, but our project would be able to compete with them as it is focused on the horror story genre giving users a place designated for that specific content. </p>
