                    <h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
                    <p>
                        Room 15's ideal jobs were Front end developer (Tristan), Junior-mid java developer (Sean), Software developer
                        (Marc), IT application developer (Tulle), Software engineer (Connor), and Full-stack software engineer (Nikola).
                        There is a common trend of choosing a developer or engineer role as an ideal job within our group, with 4 developers
                        and 2 engineers respectfully. Developers use programming languages, such as JavaScript, to write, test, debug and
                        maintain computer software and applications. Some common abilities shared by the developers of our group include
                        completing ad-hoc tasks passed down by senior developers, testing, developing and updating new & existing websites,
                        and evaluating & troubleshooting code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These developer roles share similarities with the engineer roles, who are
                        primarily tasked with managing IT systems in their workplaces to ensure that their technology & software is up to date,
                        as well as maintaining computer systems. Software engineers, regular and Full-stack, are responsible for testing,
                        configuring and troubleshooting hardware, software and networking systems, which often requires them to be experienced
                        in multiple programming languages & be able to learn new, complex systems, as highlighted in both Connor and Nikola's
                        ideal job descriptions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, the differences in these roles become apparent when examined in more detail.
                        While engineers mainly work on configuring & troubleshooting IT systems, developers focus more on designing & creating
                        new programs & software through coding. Engineers also work on physical hardware, such as installing & programming servers,
                        while developers work primarily on creating functional software & programs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        The 3 highest-ranking generic skills that weren’t required are Organisational
                        skills, Planning and Detail-Oriented.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Despite only being required for 2 of our ideal jobs, SQL is the most in-demand
                        skill sought after by employers. Structured Query Language, or SQL for short,
                        is a domain-specific language that communicates with a server-side database
                        and is the standard language for database management systems. SQL is used in
                        the storage, retrieval, management and manipulation of information on a database,
                        and is used in a wide range of IT roles such as database administrators, web
                        designers and, in the case of our group, Software developers & IT Application
                        developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript ranks second highest in demand for IT skills and is the only skill
                        required for all of our ideal jobs. JavaScript is one of the most widely used
                        programming languages on the internet, being used by 97% of all websites,
                        incorporating both CSS and HTML to create highly detailed and sophisticated
                        websites. JavaScript accounts for multiple variables, such as numbers, linking
                        strings of code, animating objects and programming functions to perform
                        specific tasks relating to a website. Being such a prevalent programming
                        language, it’s unsurprising that nearly every job in the IT industry requires
                        an understanding of JavaScript, from junior front-end developers to Google
                        software engineers.

                        Our 3rd most demanded skillset is C# development. Similar to C++, C# is an
                        object-orientated, general-purpose programming language, allowing developers
                        to build a diverse array of applications capable of running in .NET. C# can
                        also be used to develop desktop programs, website applications, cloud-based
                        services, mobile apps and games. Since C# is applicable to so many IT fields,
                        it is highly sought after by many employers, especially in the fields of software
                        engineers and developers.Our 3rd most demanded skillset is C# development. Similar

                    <p>
                        In addition to these 3 skills, our group’s ideal jobs required a number of additional
                        skills that lacked relevant information regarding demand from employers. Most of these
                        skills were specific to individual jobs, with a few exceptions that were present in
                        multiple roles.

                    <p>
                        AWS ranks 4th in terms of our ideal job’s skill set, being required for Marc, Sean and
                        Nikola’s ideal jobs. AWS, short for Amazon Web Service, is a cloud-computing platform
                        that provides a range of features including servers, storage, analytics, and a wide array
                        of developer tools & APIs, commonly used by organizations to increase their productivity
                        & lower IT costs. For Room 15, our Software Developer, Java Developer and Full-stack Engineer
                        jobs all require (or strongly prefer) an understanding of AWS, as it can be used for securely
                        storing projects & data in the cloud, allowing for easy access from other locations & by other
                        employees within the company who may also be accessing the project, and its wide variety of uses
                        makes it applicable in a range of IT fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Angular is required for 2 of our jobs: IT application developer and Java developer. Angular
                        is a development platform using a component-based framework to build scalable web
                        applications, with features including routing, online forms management, client-server
                        communication and a suite of developer tools to build, test and update code. Angular
                        would be required for Java & IT Application developers as it allows for the creation of
                        dynamic web apps suited to all kinds of environments, such as different browsers & devices
                        (eg. making a website that functions on both PC and mobile devices).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        APIs are required for our IT Application developer and Front end developer roles. APIs,
                        short for Application Programming Interface, are a kind of software that allows 2
                        applications to communicate with each other. This works by one app receiving an input,
                        prompting it to send data to a server via the internet. The server retrieves the said
                        data, manipulates it to match the input request, and then sends it back to the original
                        application. APIs are essential to front end developers, as when a user is interacting
                        with the front end of a website, APIs must be used to help navigate the page & retrieve
                        data for the end-user. They are equally as important for Application developers, as client
                        information can easily be retrieved from a cloud-based server through the use of APIs to
                        reduce application sizes.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h3>
                    <p>
                        Our general skills, in order from most demanded to least in demand, are Communication skills,
                        Problem-solving, Teamwork & Collaboration, Troubleshooting and Analytical skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Communication skills (written and verbal) are easily the most desired general skill for
                        employers, with the burning glass data indicating that it is 2.69x more demanded than the
                        2nd most desired skill. Communication is critical when working in an IT environment, as
                        you will have to undertake many tasks that involve communicating with other employees,
                        such as working in a team to complete a project for a client, or when undertaking Ad-hoc
                        tasks passed onto you by a manager. Informing your fellow employees of your progress when
                        undertaking a project is vital for meeting deadlines & is great for productivity, thus
                        making strong communicators highly sought after when a business is searching for new
                        employees. This was also the most prevalent attribute among our ideal jobs, with 3 of the
                        5 available job listings specifying strong communication skills as a desired trait.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are the three highest-ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3>
                    <p>
                        The 3 highest-ranking IT skills that weren’t required are Microsoft Windows, Project Management and SAP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft Windows is a pretty broad area, however, I assume it refers to the ability to use Microsoft
                        programs such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Project Management, in regards to IT, involves managing the planning, organisation and accountability
                        of a group of employees to complete a project or IT goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SAP, short for System Analysis Program Development, is an enterprise planning resource software used
                        in large businesses. SAP is a centralised system that enables every department within a business
                        to access & share the same data, allowing employees from different areas of the company to easily
                        communicate & exchange data with one another. This can be used in a number of fields, including
                        reporting transactions, accounting, hiring new staff, managing projects & communicating information
                        to every department.
