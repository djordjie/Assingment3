                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our group, Room 15, is designing a website called
                        Horror Stories. This website will be a place for
                        people to gather, read and share horror stories from
                        their lives, real life horror stories, from various
                        different areas of life. Areas such as a real-estate,
                        employment, dating, shopping, travelling, family, and
                        beliefs. From these main areas users will be able to
                        further filter down their desired topic with a variety
                        of sub menus. Apart from reading and posting, users will
                        also be able to rate stories, leave comments and set
                        preferences for types of stories, and then have those
                        preferences represented on a home page in a feed of
                        recommended stories. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Motivation  </h3>
                    <p>
                        The motivation behind this website is there is very little competition
                        for a website that is dedicated to just everyday horror stories. While
                        there are quite a few websites that may include them in an occasional
                        post, none of these websites are focused just on peoples bad experiences.
                        Everyone has a horror story from their life, whether it be a creepy
                        neighbour, childhood bully, crazy date or overbearing manager. People
                        need places to talk about these horror stories, to vent or just to get
                        it off their chest. While there are plenty of sub-reddits and forums
                        that exist for this purpose there are very little dedicated apps or
                        websites on the subject. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Description  </h3>
                    <p>
                        When a user opens the website, they are greeted with a home page that
                        will give the user two options, sign in or read the posts. The sign in
                        option will be for people who want to post, rate a post or reply to a post.
                        The home page would also include a random post from one of the listings. If
                        the user chooses to log in they will then be directed back to a personalised
                        home page with a grid layout of recently viewed posts and some new posts
                        from their favourite sub menus. Whether the user chooses to log in or not,
                        there will be a high tier menu for them to choose from for general categories.
                        These include real-estate, employment, dating, shopping, travelling, family,
                        beliefs and travelling. From here the user will select a category and they
                        will be taken to that categories page. All posts from all that categories
                        subcategories groups will be listed, the user can then choose a subcategory.
                        For example , under real estate there would be subcategories for Landlords,
                        Home Owner Associations, Moving Property, House Mates, and Neighbours. For
                        employment, the subcategories would be, Work Mates, Bosses, Customers,
                        Interviews and Wages. For dating, the subcategories would be Messaging,,
                        First Dates, Meeting in Real Life and Profiles. For shopping, the categories
                        would be Amazon, Ebay, Craigs List, Wish, Facebook, and Buying in a Shop. For
                        travelling, the subcategories would be, Getting There/Back, Cultural Problems,
                        Accommodation, Booking Travel and Sight Seeing. For Family the subcategories
                        would be In Laws, Parents, Siblings, Cousins, Significant Others and Kids. For
                        Beliefs, the subcategories would be, Religion, Conspiracy Theories, and Culture . 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user can then decide whether to read all the stories from the base category
                        or go into a subcategory and read those specific stories. As the option to rate,
                        comment or post a new story needs the user to be logged in, those options will
                        still be there but will redirect the user to log in first. Once logged in, user
                        settings' will also become available where the user can select a username,
                        change password, select favourite categories, view their previous contributions
                        and upload a picture. Once the user has logged in they can then upload an image
                        as part of their story or as their story, comment on other posts and rate posts. 
                        The website would have an administrator backend, which would enable administrators
                        to add posts, which would be very useful when the website is in its infancy,
                        delete posts, delete users and create new subcategories if the current ones
                        prove to be not as unique and fitting for the more popular posts. The data
                        for the posts can be gathered from various sources on the internet including
                        Twitter, Reddit, Failblog, Cheeseburger, BoredPanda and more. Credit will be
                        given for any data outsourced and not provided by an individual user sharing
                        their own story. As Version 1 will be hosted on Github to get proof of concept
                        using Wordpress, there will be no start-up costs or ongoing costs for Version 1.
                        Wordpress has hundreds of extensions that will allow user registration, user
                        posts and comments, rating posts, user settings and uploading images. Depending
                        on storage limits and the popularity of the website costs could start if the need
                        arose to migrate to another site. These could be offset by monetising the website
                        with advertising either through relevant affiliate marketing ads or google ads. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once proof of concept proves to work, the website would be switched to its own domain
                        name and service provider, which again still wouldn’t need its own database as the
                        Wordpress extensions take care of this. For Version 2 we would put other options for
                        signing up apart from just using an email address such as Google, Facebook or Microoft.
                        Monetising the website, a report post option so that the post can be reviewed by an
                        administrator and report comment option. There would also become the option to share
                        a post on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Plus send out an email
                        requiring a new user to verify their email address if they use email to sign up with.
                        Plus the website would become mobile friendly. Version 3 would see the creation of an app,
                        creation of social media pages with stories attached to gain attraction to the website.
                        A monthly cash prize if your story is featured on the home page. Creating competitions
                        for social media for certain topics, ie Online Dating where the winner of the worst
                        horror story gets a cash prize. If the Wordpress site starts to struggle it could be
                        migrated to a database such as Amazon Web Services, which would require several
                        databases and someone with the skills to migrate Wordpress data to a database,
                        but this would not be envisaged for some time. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies  </h3>
                    <p>
                        The main tools for this proof-of-concept website would be Wordpress and Github.
                        There is a guide available found in the references that provides up step by step
                        process to intergrating Wordpress with Github. Once that is done and plugins chosen
                        from the Wordpress website. The only other tool would be Notepad or Notepad++ as
                        an editor to the Wordpress template. That would be about the extent of the tools
                        required for this website. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Skills Required  </h3>
                    <p>
                        Completion of this project would require further experience in Programming
                        in HTML and Wordpress. While Wordpress is basically HTML there are quite a
                        few nuances in it. So the group would be required to read a basic how to
                        guide on Wordpress to be able to successfully edit the code. Things like
                        adding menus and pages can be quite time consuming if you don’t know what
                        you are doing and the process while similar to HTML is harder as there are
                        so many elements you are dealing with. Even though we would be starting with a template this will still need to be heavily modified to allow all the criteria that we have specified in the description. This is where the knowledge of Wordpress is required.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Outcome  </h3>
                    <p>
                        If the project is successful it should create a fun and entertaining space
                        for users to read interesting stories while thankful that it wasn’t them.
                        No doubt some users will be able to relate to the posts and may include
                        their story in the comments or create a separate post. The users should
                        have no problems signing up or signing in and posting either images or
                        text under the relevant sub-category should go without an error. To gauge
                        the success of the website would be to analyse user uptake. While with
                        Version 1 the uptake would be expected to be slow, with Versions 2 & 3,
                        it should really give it a kick start. Especially once it starts on
                        social media as there are a lot of free ways for promotion through
                        these avenues. Especially once the website is monetised and the $50
                        bonus starts.
