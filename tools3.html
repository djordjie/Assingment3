                    <h3>GitHub</h3>
                    <p>
                        GitHub is a user-friendly website based on Git created
                        by Linus Torvalds in 2005 as an accessible version
                        control database, which is very popular with developers
                        for its said version control. GitHub built upon this by
                        creating a friendly user interface that didn’t require
                        the knowledge of line-based commands. It is a for-profit
                        cloud-based service that allows users to collaborate on
                        projects within their organisation and includes version
                        control. Once signed into GitHub, users need to create a
                        repository where the files will be kept. The user can
                        create subfolders, and different branches shared publicly
                        or with select users via username and password. GitHub
                        makes its money from businesses wishing to create secure
                        private repositories for team collaboration. But it is
                        free for users to create public repositories for open-source
                        projects and student assignments. There is also a vast array
                        of extensions from other platforms such as WordPress that
                        work with GitHub making it a great way to deploy your project.
                        Not all team members will be using GitHub for assignment 2;
                        only the members create the website and update it. For assignment
                        3, all team members will be using GitHub as we all work on the project.
                    </p>
                    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
                    <p>
                        GitHub Pages allows you to build websites to showcase your
                        portfolio, projects, documentation, or other things you want
                        to share online. GitHub pages are easy to set up as there are
                        no servers or databases, and you don’t need to know HTML.
                        GitHub uses an open-source tool called Jekyll that can turn
                        plain text files into websites. Jekyll also supports templates,
                        templates, drafts, and variables. GitHub Pages allows you to test
                        new concepts before deploying the website live, and if the test is
                        positive, you can quickly push the new content to the live website.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Ms Teams</h3>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft Teams has few competitors able to offer an all-in-one office environment.
                        It provides file sharing, instant messaging, and video/audio conference calling and
                        aligns with the Microsoft 365 office suite and its partners. While there are a few
                        shortcomings, such as version control of documents and online editing, it has
                        distinguished itself as a leader in this space. Allowing students to use all its
                        features for free certainly encourages its use as these students enter employment
                        and move up through the ranks of their chosen profession.
                        Microsoft Teams has been built from the ground up, utilising the Microsoft Azure
                        cloud platform and other Microsoft technologies. It is to use and share documents
                        with the user interface being very user friendly. If you’re not a student,
                        the service is available on a subscription-based level, depending on your
                        requirements. The team uses Microsoft Teams for video meetings twice per
                        week, which are recorded and saved, uploading their parts of the project,
                        creating agendas for meetings, and notifying each other of updates.

                    <h3>Burning Glass</h3>
                    <p>
                        Burning Glass is a data-driven analytical company that provides data led
                        information on the constantly evolving jobs market. It is aimed at employers,

                        worldwide and shows where new trends are developing. It has apps for anyone
                        involved in employing, education or looking for a job to display real-time
                        trending skills and attributes required.  This was used for the Industry Data
                        part of our assignment.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Visual Studio</h3>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft’s Visual studio will be our group’s primary tool for coding.
                        This Integrated Development Environment is one of the most helpful tools
                        for web services, applications, apps, etc. The first Visual studio version
                        was introduced in 1997 as Visual Studio 97. Microsoft offers three different
                        editions of Visual studio. These editions are the community edition,
                        professional edition, and enterprise edition. It’s a beneficial tool
                        that makes developing websites, apps or even games more accessible.
                        We have used this tool for our website and for our prototype artifact
                        program for editing stories and for enabling users to log in with their
                        password and username details. Visual Studio 2022 Community supports
                        systems with minimum requirements therefore it wasn’t hard for Sean to
                        develop this on his computer. Visual Studio supports many programming
                        languages and this was ideal because Sean was able to use his past experience
                        with the programming language VB.NET and was able to develop a functional prototype.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Visio</h3>
                    <p>
                        Visio is another unique tool for creating flowcharts and different 
                        kinds of diagrams. Microsoft’s Visio is one of its kind. With so many 
                        possible templates and hundreds of shapes and objects to choose from,
                        it became a very popular program used by many corporations. It can be 
                        used for brainstorming complex ideas where data must be visually 
                        inspected. There are also diagrams for maps that can be used for 3D
                        map modelling. Visio makes it easy to pull data directly from 
                        spreadsheets which is one of the best features. Our group used 
                        this powerful tool to create two artifacts: the web frame and sitemap.
