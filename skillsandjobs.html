                        Room 15 is currently developing a website known as Horror Stories, we are however inexperienced in web development and only has four weeks in total to develop the idea, thus it is unlikely that the full breadth of our initial plan or a sustainable version will come into fruition, however in a hypothetical world where we have all resources, that outcome could be quite different, let us explore this hypothetical world. A venture capitalist was interested in our web idea and gave us funding to hire four members of a development team, to develop our web idea in six months. A Graphic designer for creation of assets, Front-end developer for writing of the user experience code,
                        Back-end developer for the writing of the background code and a Chief financial officer for managing of the projects funding would all be required for full time development of Horror Stories.
                        First, we would have to start with a basic concepting phase, this would include writing up basic demos of isolated ideas before further connecting them, and drawing concept artwork, which would require our Graphic Designer
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Graphic designers are individuals whose knowledge of IT and art allows them specialization in the use of programs Such as Adobe’s Photoshop, Affinity Photo, et cetera, for the creation of digital assets used in the visuals of a computer program, Digital assets can range from textures in a 3D engine, background images on websites, Sprites, User interfaces and more.
                        The appearance of something, a website in this case, often affects an individual’s opinion on that thing. Suppose a website is not formatted in a pleasant to view or intuitive manner, then the user’s opinion on the website will be negatively affected, if instead a website is formatted in a modern manner to remind a user of websites that they are already comfortable then chances are, the user will be satisfied with their experience, so long as all other aspects are satisfactory that is.
                        For the development of the website Horror Stories, a Graphic designer would be required to collaborate with fellow team members, such as a Front-end developer, to create the look of the website, for the design of User interfaces and interactable. User interfaces allow people to interact with the website, to navigate themselves through to other sections of the website such as settings, or to specify their favourite genre of horror story on the main page, as well as represent a horror story which a user can then read and interact with further.
                        Through the development of an appropriate and easy to utilize user interface, one may find themself feeling “comfy” on the website, which will in-turn influence a user to keep using the website and recommend it to their peers, friends, family or colleagues, Graphic designers are typically the ones developing the look of these assets, with oversite from a production or managerial team member. Graphic designers will often collaborate with Front-end developers on other portions of a websites look as well, such as fonts. A simple change of font can convey an entirely different message to the reader, for instance, by using a font that is italicized text becomes more elegant though harder to read, whereas a word that has been boldened seems louder and is more eligible to a reader. Graphic designers must take careful consideration for even something as simple as a font to ensure that a website has a cohesive look.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Graphic designers do not work alone on the look of a website however, they are just the person with the most influence over the strict look, however, to properly implement this look they need to work with a Front-end developer.
                        Front-end developers are people who have studied programming languages such as HTML for basic web display code, CSS for the more detailed looks such as fonts and JavaScript for more complicated web page behaviour, these developers will work closely with all other forms of developers, in this case Graphic designers and Back-end developers, to ensure that the original vision of an idea can be realised visually and technically.
                        HTML is the basic coding language used in a large majority of all web pages across the internet, and forms the skeleton of webpages, where many other coding languages for web development build onto the underlying HTML of a website.
                        though a website can technically run in its entirety off of a document of HTML code, this would be a rather lacklustre website and is limited by using only a single coding language, to expand on this you would use other coding languages such as JavaScript or CSS.
                        CSS is an acronym that stands for Cascading Style Sheets but is also a coding language utilized through tying in with the underlying HTML to properly format the websites Look and feel. A Front-end developer will utilize a CSS document to designate word spacing, our previously mentioned ever important fonts, as well as the look of the websites borders and implementing any effects that the Graphic designer has created for the webpage.
                        Any further development of a websites User interaction will often be done through JavaScript. JavaScript is a coding language used in a multitude of ways across an astounding majority of all websites across the internet for basic and complicated client-side behaviour. Back-end developers could utilise JavaScript for animated stories and other multimedia elements, for instance if we wish to dive headfirst into fictional stories then users would be able to design their own stories on the website and could use complicated graphics, such an implementation would require JavaScript.
                        None of this would bear fruit if it were not for a Back-end developer.

                        Back-end developers are people who understand and have studied HTML, SQL, C++, Java and JavaScript and use these skills to develop the behind-the-scenes code for a website or application, for instance a Back-end developer is the one coding a login system and then the Front-end developer pushes that code in a way that is presentable and visually interactive for the user. Back-end developers are also in charge of upkeeping databases and other online stores that keep information for the website, which will quite often utilise Structured Query Language or SQL. SQL is a coding language used in server applications and is great for coding anything that must send or receive a high amount of data and data flow. C++ and Java are both multipurpose coding languages that can be used to write a variety of programs, for instance many video games such as Minecraft have been coded with java, and the basis for the Unreal engine is written entirely in C++.
                        Horror Stories will require a server to keep all information related to user login information, other user information such as alias, submitted stories, user ratings for submitted stories, story comments and ratings. This server can be coded by the Back-end developer by utilizing either C++ or Java, C++ is the more likely candidate as despite being platform dependent C++ is the faster language. After creation of a server the website still does not know how to communicate with it, that is where SQL comes into play. The Back-end developer will need to code an independent program or program layer with SQL that can take the requests of the website for certain information, such as when a user is reading a story, the SQL layer will take this request and communicate it to the server in a way the server understands and take the specific information needed, in this case a stories comments, ratings and the text for the story, the SQL layer having received this information hands it off to the main website which will display it as the Front-end and Back-end developers dictate.
                        A Back-end developer must also work with all other related developers on implementing monetisation correctly, including the Chief financial officer.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Chief financial officer of a company is the one responsible for heavily influencing financial decisions, normally through an open dialogue with the chief executive officer and through their experience and understanding of the local or global economies. CFO’s pay attention to market trends, such as the rise and fall of supply and demand in related products, armed with this information a CFO will be able to make educated decisions on pricing for a product, or evaluate potential stock buyers, CFO’s will then discuss these decisions with the CEO who will use all information gathered to make a final decision.
                        In a hypothetical large scale social media such as Horror Stories a CFO would be required to review plans for multiple aspects, such as monetization. When the project inevitably arrives to talk of monetization, several choices must be made on what type of monetization will be pursued, in this instance, a subscription system or advertisements, it is a CFO’s job, along with the CEO, to investigate all options for a financial future and implement whatever strategies and systems are required for all employees.
                        Subscription models are where users are offered the ability to use an app while paying for it with small but consistent payments, these payments would be paid weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, annually, etcetera. A CFO must pay attention to market trends in monetization of competitors and ask questions such as, what is the average cost of a similar service and what is the user retention of said service to better understand what Users are comfortable with paying and how often, a CFO must also consult engineers on the required cost to run any services, such as power draw for 24/7 servers, and take this cost into consideration when discussing any monetary schemes, so as to ensure the website is making a profit.
                        Advertisements are when a company of any given product ranging from furniture to computer components, pays the website a certain fee over a period to have advertisements for a product or service listed somewhere on the website. It is the CFO’s job to research any potential products or services, along with the CEO, to determine its market value and thus the value in hosting advertisements for it on the website
                        CFO’s must take everything into consideration when planning for the company’s future and consult all members of board or otherwise heads of the group, to ensure a financially beneficial future for the project.
